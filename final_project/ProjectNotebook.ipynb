    "PROJECT DESCRIPTION\n",
    "    I created a chatbot for this project. The chatbot we learned in A3 is mainly continue with a free-flow conversation. I wanted to try something different, so I decided to make a chatbot that will lead the conversation toward a certain goal. The conversation will appear to be less natural but more functional. The conversation is intended to go certain way, and it should be similar to a interactive menu. By providing options, I limit the user's input so that I can set conditions that'll make the chatbot respond differently based on the input. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   The goal of this chatbot is to help the user decide on what to cook. There's many instances when I wanted to cook but I couldn't on what exactly to cook. This chatbot can help by identifying preferences and use randomization to fill in other parts. This chatbot will first take in the user's dietary suggestion and filter the potential recommendations. For example, eliminate meat if user's vegan. Next, it'll take in meat preference or provide options. Then, depending on the cusine preference, this chatbot will provide spice recommendation by refering to a cooking website. Lastly, it'll randomly provide recommendations for carbs and veggies. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Aside from my lack of experience in coding, there are a few challengse I face in this project. First, I have to figure out how to keep track of the progress in this conversation and how to seperate different conditions. I ended up using running_count to execute this, since I can't really think of a better way. It works now but it can overcomplicate things if I keep expanding the code. It also makes the code more lengthy. Secondly, I have to consider how to pull out the keywords from each user's input so that the chatbot can respond correspondingly. This is different from A3 because the user's input will determine the prompt for next input. If the user's input is not what is expected, the conversation cannot progress. Thirdly, I learn the basics of BeautifulSoup in order to pull out info from a cooking website. I use indexing to selectively present the content of the website because I can't differentiate the context using just tags. There should be a more efficient way to do it but it seems to involved a lot more extended knowledge. Overall, I managed to execute what I'm hoping for with my current programming ability."
